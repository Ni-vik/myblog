I am living in a time dominated by technology. Each day you will read about some new breakthrough somewhere in some field.
Just to name a few in recent years : 

#LLM 

LLMs are popular right now. It all started with the  "Attention is all you need" paper and transformers were introduced. OpenAI used it to create chatGPT. It grabbed the media attention specially because of AI safety issues and because people were really loving this new chatbot which could help them in their work. Some were terrified that they might lose their jobs. 

At first it was considered that robots will replace the people working in construction and all these places where human labour or more specifically physical labour. But turns out with modern tech it is the creative jobs like writing and coding are getting replaced. It is called the Moravec's paradox.

After the success of chatGPT it was seen as the mark for new tech and also that now the traditional tech comapnies have to change. Microsoft invested in OpenAI to get that benefit and also to challenge Google's monopoly in search. To combat that Google came up with it's owm chatbot Bard. Did Microsoft succeed in getting the market share I don't think so but they did make Google make moves to change.

Then Meta prevoiusly Facebook decided to go the open source way and released their model for the public. Even though it is not completely open source it's licensing isn't the one which will allow  you to use it for commerical purposes. Then came the other open source LLMs like Mistral and others.

So new benchmarks are still coming up with time and the LLM research isn't going to stop soon. Let's see what does the future hold for LLM research.


#Stable Diffusion 

Another thing getting popular these days is stable diffusion to generate images and art. Yeah who saw that coming? Dall E , Midjourney and many others.



#AR/VR 

Have you watched ready player one? If you haven't I will suggest you do watch it. Dystopian setting where people wear VRs and spend their days in a virtual world mostly competing in games. Is that what the future looks like? Meta thinks so. They have decided to go all in on this AR/VR thing. They have their VR headsets and now Apple is joining this and they have already introduced their Apple vision pro. Movies , real world interactions, games all this in virtual space. So you are telling me that all these adventures we see in movies and games. I can live all those. Recently I tried the VR for the first time and I am in for that future. Only thing which concerns me is will we die scrolling through this endless world forgetting to eat. ( Took this from George Hotz interview with Lex Fridman)

#Self Driving Cars

Another thing which is in trend is self driving cars. Honestly in India I don't see a future for them. Good luck to other countries trying to acheive these.

#Computation

Nvidia is growing like crazy after renting those GPUs for LLMs and all other AI tasks. New GPUs TPUs will be required as we scale these models. Quantum computing has security people concerned as the strongest encryption we have today could be broken in seconds using these quantum computers. 



So in short tons of tech to work on near future and endless opportunities in cutting edge tech. 

So to answer the question future is uncertain :)
